            The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is the national space agency of India. It operates as the primary research and development arm
             of the Department of Space (DoS), which is directly overseen by the
              Prime Minister of India, while the Chairman of ISRO also acts as the executive
            of DoS. ISRO is primarily 
            responsible for performing tasks related to space-based operations, space exploration, international space cooperation and the development of related technologies.
            It is one of the 6 largest space agencies in the world today. ISRO maintains one of
             the biggest fleets of remote sensing (IRS) and communication (INSAT) satellites catering to the needs
             of the nation through a network of centres, offices, and research institutes in different parts of the country.
